# Complex Voronoi

A visualization of complex numbers being plotted in a grid, where the real component is on the x-axis and imaginary component is on the y-axis. These numbers are the than raised to a power, **n**, which is fractionally incremented and decremented over time, therefore creating the animation.

Toggling display modes allows a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) of the points to be displayed. The color of each polygon is a function if its area.
